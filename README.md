rails-mrap-seed
===============

For those who need to go fast on Rails.
---------------------------------------

This is the seed project I wish I had for my last hackathons.

## The Stack:

### Main Players:

  * Mongoid (Wrapper for MongoDB)
  * HAML
  * Bootstrap (Sass flavored)
  * RSpec
  * Capybara (Preconfigured to use Poltergeist for fast BDD)

### Fast Testing!

  * Zeus (Saves too much time, run specs immediately)
  * Guard (Automatically runs the correct spec after you save the file)

### Fast Deployment!

  Preconfigured for Heroku.  `Foreman` for development, `Unicorn` for production.
  [Details](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4) here.
  Note: Requires a MongoDB add-on. I use MongoHQ.

## Getting Started

  This will be completed in another commit.
